functional javascript programming
=====

Functional programming is the use of functions that transform values into units of abstraction, subsequently used to build software systems.

function - exists on its own

method - fn created in context of an object

closure - a function that captures the external bindings (ie not its own arguments) contained in the scope in which it was defined for later user (even after the scope has completed)
